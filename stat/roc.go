package stat

// ROC returns paired false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate
// (TPR) values corresponding to cutoff points on the receiver operator
// characteristic (ROC) curve obtained when y is treated as a binary
// classifier for classes with weights. The cutoff thresholds used to
// calculate the ROC are returned in thresh such that tpr[i] and fpr[i]
// are the true and false positive rates for y >= thresh[i].
//
// The input y and cutoffs must be sorted, and values in y must correspond
// to values in classes and weights. SortWeightedLabeled can be used to
// sort y together with classes and weights.
//
// For a given cutoff value, observations corresponding to entries in y
// greater than the cutoff value are classified as false, while those
// less than or equal to the cutoff value are classified as true. These
// assigned class labels are compared with the true values in the classes
// slice and used to calculate the FPR and TPR.
//
// If weights is nil, all weights are treated as 1.
//
// If cutoffs is nil or empty, all possible cutoffs are calculated,
// resulting in fpr and tpr having length one greater than the number of
// unique values in y. Otherwise fpr and tpr will be returned with the
// same length as cutoffs. floats.Span can be used to generate equally
// spaced cutoffs.
//
// More details about ROC curves are available at
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic
